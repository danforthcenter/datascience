# Globus Connect

## What is Globus Connect?

[Globus Connect](https://www.globus.org) is a service for file transfer
and sharing. The Globus file transfer service can transfer data between
two endpoints, automatically ensuring that file integrity is maintained.
Users initiate the transfer process, which runs in the background, and
will be notified via email when the transfer is complete.

The Data Science Facility at the Danforth Center provides a
Globus Endpoint for system users and a public account for read-only
access to shared data sets.

## Accessing the Data Science Endpoint

First, authenticate with Globus. Point your browser to [https://www.globus.org](https://www.globus.org)
and either sign up for a Globus ID or authenticate with one of their
other providers (e.g. Google).

Second, authenticate with the Data Science endpoint. From the File Manager
interface, click on Collection box "--start here, select a collection--".
Search for the endpoint "Danforth Center Data Science".

If you are one of our users, log in with your Data Science username/password
to access your own files. If you want to access publicly available datasets,
use the following credentials

```
Username: ddpscglobus
Password: Yb11&rDA%T
```

Finally, log into a second endpoint either at your institution or create
a [personal Globus Connect endpoint](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect).

Once connected, connect to the source or destination endpoint and
initiate the desired file transfers.
